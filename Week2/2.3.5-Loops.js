// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let currentNumber = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let total = 0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while(currentNumber <= 100){
    total = currentNumber;
    currentNumber++;
}
console.log(total);

// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100
let currentTotal = 0;
for (let i=1; i<=100; i++){
    currentTotal += i;
}
console.log(currentTotal);
// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
